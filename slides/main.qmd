# Backing up

## Stats 101

- What are the goals of statistics?
- Estimating some function $f : X \to Y$
  - Sometimes we make assumptions about $f$, e.g. linear regression
- Simpler models lead to easier interpretation
- But sometimes they don't work well, e.g., when number of samples or number of variables is very large.
