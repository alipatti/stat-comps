\section{Introduction}

This paper is based on the following hunch: Summary stats don't fully capture the state of basketball games. It is often the case that---despite a game being tied---there is one team that is ``playing better'' and most fans watching the game would expect to win. This paper attempts to capture this idea by modeling sports games as sequences of \emph{events}, for example shots and rebounds. Over the course of this paper, we develop a model that, after each event, output a probability $p_t$ that the home team will ultimately win. We then train several variants of this model, evaluate their performance, and attempt to explain why they don't do as well as we had originally hoped.
