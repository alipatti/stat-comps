\section{Conclusion}

we modeled sports as sequences with the hope of being able

they did learn to predict winners, but were unable to outpreform the naive method of picking the currently-winning team.

\subsection{Reasons for under-performance}

lots of scoring in basketball, maybe score just is the best predictor of the winner

there are a few reasons why this may be the case

\subsection{Future work}

different sports

there's less scoring in soccer and hockey

if we think of chances as random events, when you sum them all up, you end up with a lower-variance estimate of the mean in basketball than you would in soccer and hockey

more data

different model (transformer in particular)
