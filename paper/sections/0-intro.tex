\section{Introduction}

summary stats don't fully capture the state of a game

fans watching often have an ``eye test'' that (they claim) more accurately can asses the state of the game

``X team is playing better---they should win''

this paper attempts to model this

sports games are sequences of events, for example shots, passes, rebounds, etc.

The goal of our analysis is as follows: After each event $x_t$, we would like output a probability $p_t$ that the home team will win the game. In this section, we develop the necessary background to define the model that we use to do this.

we model basketball games as sequences of these using a form of deep learning known as a recurrent neural network

these have fallen out of fashion recently in favor of the more complex and better performing transformer model
