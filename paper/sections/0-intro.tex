\section{Introduction}

summary stats don't fully capture the state of a game

fans watching often have an ``eye test'' that (they claim) more accurately can asses the state of the game

``X team is playing better---they should win''

this paper attempts to model this

sports games are sequences of events, for example shots, passes, rebounds, etc.

we model basketball games as sequences of these using a form of deep learning known as a recurrent neural network

these have fallen out of fashion recently in favor of the more complex and better performing transformer model
