	ABSTRACT = {Developing an effective sports performance analysis process
	            is an attractive issue in sports team management. This study
	            proposed an improved sports outcome prediction process by
	            integrating adaptive weighted features and machine learning
	            algorithms for basketball game score prediction. The feature
	            engineering method is used to construct designed features
	            based on game-lag information and adaptive weighting of
	            variables in the proposed prediction process. These designed
	            features are then applied to the five machine learning
	            methods, including classification and regression trees (CART)
	            , random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB),
	            eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and extreme learning
	            machine (ELM) for constructing effective prediction models.
	            The empirical results from National Basketball Association
	            (NBA) data revealed that the proposed sports outcome
	            prediction process could generate a promising prediction
	            result compared to the competing models without adaptive
	            weighting features. Our results also showed that the machine
	            learning models with four game-lags information and adaptive
	            weighting of power could generate better prediction
	            performance.},

	            popularity, as demonstrated by massive financial transactions
	            in sports betting. One of the world's popular sports that
	            lures betting and attracts millions of fans worldwide is
	            basketball, particularly the National Basketball Association
	            (NBA) of the United States. This paper proposes a new
	            intelligent machine learning framework for predicting the
	            results of games played at the NBA by aiming to discover the
	            influential features set that affects the outcomes of NBA
	            games. We would like to identify whether machine learning
	            methods are applicable to forecasting the outcome of an NBA
	            game using historical data (previous games played), and what
	            are the significant factors that affect the outcome of games.
	            To achieve the objectives, several machine learning methods
	            that utilise different learning schemes to derive the models,
	            including Na{\"{\i}}ve Bayes, artificial neural network, and
	            Decision Tree, are selected. By comparing the performance and
	            the models derived against different features sets related to
	            basketball games, we can discover the key features that
	            contribute to better performance such as accuracy and
	            efficiency of the prediction model. Based on the results
	            analysis, the DRB (defensive rebounds) feature was chosen and
	            was deemed as the most significant factor influencing the
	            results of an NBA game. Furthermore, others crucial factors
	            such as TPP (three-point percentage), FT (free throws made),
	            and TRB (total rebounds) were also selected, which
	            subsequently increased the model's prediction accuracy rate
	            by 2--4{\%}.",

	            mechanism and put forward an AS-LSTM model for predicting
	            match results. Furthermore, to ensure the timeliness of the
	            prediction, we add the time sliding window to make the
	            prediction have better timeliness. Taking the football match
	            as an example, we carried out a case study and proposed the
	            feasibility of this method.},
